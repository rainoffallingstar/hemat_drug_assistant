## Introduction (Generated by KIMI)

The Hematology Drug Assistant is a comprehensive application designed for hematology professionals, aiming to provide accurate drug dosage calculations and treatment plan recommendations.

Application Highlights:

- Personalized drug dosage calculation: Based on the patient's basic information (such as age, gender, weight, height, etc.), the application automatically calculates the appropriate drug dosage for the patient, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the treatment plan.

- Treatment plan recommendations: According to the patient's disease type (such as leukemia, lymphoma, etc.), targeted treatment plans are provided.

- Drug side effects and interactions: A detailed list of side effects and possible drug interactions of various drugs, helping to fully consider the patient's safety and comfort when formulating treatment plans.

- Prognostic scoring systems and commonly used clinical tools: Including various prognostic scoring systems for blood diseases, such as IPI, MDAPSS, etc., to help you better assess the treatment risks and outcomes for patients.

- Easy switching between plans and language selection: The application supports easy switching between different treatment plans and provides both Chinese and English interfaces to meet the needs of different users.

- Real-time updates and continuous improvement: We will continue to focus on the latest research and progress in hematology drug studies and treatment plans, updating the application in a timely manner to provide you with the most cutting-edge treatment recommendations.

Please note that this application is under active development, and we recommend that you carefully check the content of the plans before incorporating it into your routine clinical operations and decision-making processes.

## Software Architecture

1. Treatment plans are saved as individual Excel files named according to the plan name in subfolders named after the disease, located in the "data" folder.

2. The variable names in the pickerInput are automatically scanned and cleaned by the program, decoupling the program code from the data folder.

3. The template for the Excel file can be found in the temple.xlsx file, with the following content:
